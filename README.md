Sample Usage
=========

This is a library that uses your trusty little Modernizr to give you the possibility of specifying required features for a certain stylesheet.
Using it is a simple matter, illustrated in the following excerpt:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="modernizr.js"></script>
    <script src="detectizr.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      Modernizr.Detectizr.detect({detectScreen:false});
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
Just remember to include Modernizr before Detectizr, and you're good to go!
